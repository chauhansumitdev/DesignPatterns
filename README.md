 # Design Patterns 

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design. They represent best practices and provide general solutions for recurring design challenges. There are several design patterns categorized into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Here's a list of some well-known design patterns:

**Creational Patterns:**
1. **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating the instance in a factory method.
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
5. **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

**Structural Patterns:**
1. **Adapter Pattern:** Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
2. **Bridge Pattern:** Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
3. **Composite Pattern:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
4. **Decorator Pattern:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
5. **Facade Pattern:** Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

**Behavioral Patterns:**
1. **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
2. **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
3. **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby parameterizing clients with queues, requests, and operations.
4. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Passes the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
5. **State Pattern:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

These patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems and are widely used in software development to enhance flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
